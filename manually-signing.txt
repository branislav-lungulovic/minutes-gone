You do not need Android Studio to sign your app.
You can sign your app from the command line using standard tools from the Android SDK and the JDK. To sign an app in release mode from the command line −

    Generate a private key using keytool

$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

    Compile your app in release mode to obtain an unsigned APK

    Sign your app with your private key using jarsigner

$ jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore my_application.apk alias_name

    Verify that your APK is signed. For example −

$ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs my_application.apk

    Align the final APK package using zipalign.

$ zipalign -v 4 your_project_name-unaligned.apk your_project_name.apk
